Paul Assembly Language (PAL)

This repo contains two folders: 
      ./pal
      ./palsm

The source code of ./pal is for the PAL Virtual Machine (known as the PALVM) and ./palsm is for the PAL assembler. Appropriate README's will be included for each folder soon.

This project is written solely in Golang.

General usage for both executables:
  ./pal <file.pal>|<file.bin> (will temporarily create a .bin file if provided a .pal file as a result of lexing and assembling the source code)
  ./palsm <file.pal>

THIS PROJECT IS FOR PERSONAL TEACHING ABOUT GOLANG, GENERAL EXPERIMENTATION, AND LEISURE. ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ARE APPRECIATED.
